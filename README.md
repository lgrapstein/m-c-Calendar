McKinsey Code Challenge
- Create a calendar that takes as input an array of objects.
- Each object contains a start time and an end time for the event.
- When two events collide they appear next to each other, otherwise the calendar event blocks sit on top of each other.
- Try to replicate as much as possible the layout in this image.
